<p style="width: 95%; height: auto; color: white;">Our brain is so mysterious. We know very little about it. We use a few portions of the brain. What will happen if we use 100% of our brain? As per the movie "LUCY" which says if we use 100% of our brain we will stay out of space-time block, we can see past, future, and present, and we will remain present all the place togetherly. But how much is true? We can recall the past but not the future. There is some concept that the time arrow only flows in the forward direction. If we reverse the time arrow then we can recall the future but not the past. This means if we reverse the time arrow then the broken thing will get back to its shape again which is against the causality effect. So we can not recall the future. Now brain's function is not only to memorize but also to think about a matter. Now thinking is such a power that we can do everything in it. But in the brain, we can design the future by predicting past experiences. Now if we use 100% of our brain then control of our body parts will increase, six senses will develop and many other things will happen when we will use 100% then we will be able to know about it. To understand the brain I have conducted some experiments.
    EXPERIMENT 1:I have chosen one person. For someday I sent the person some beautiful SMS then sudden blocking to the person.
    EXPERIMENT 2:After watching some romantic love story started to listen to the binaural beat.
    EXPERIMENT 3:Used your left hand in most of the work.
    EXPERIMENT 4:Behave like a foolish leader.
    Now it is to explain the reason for this mad experiment. Now it is clear that on whom you are performing the experiment he/she will you as a fool or mad. Now I shall give an example by which you will be able to understand the reason .suppose, you are in a dark room for a long time when someone in the light you annoying. But in normal time the light is nothing to you. Mean when habituating with a thing for a long time then sudden change create a peculiar thing in your brain. In this way, you can create your image to the mind of when you want. It is a basic of brain hacking.
    Now those are very basic experiments. There is another experiment. Like as we talk to a girl and a boy in a different manner. What will happen if we interchange the character. Result: next day both of them will not take your call.
    Now you can understand all the experient is a type of prank. Mean prank can create which type of effect it is.
    This type of experiment creates a bad relationship with any person. Now there is another concept that why I am writing this ? is it the message to the people that why I behaved badly with the people? or research? It is the assignment to my reader.</p>
